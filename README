Summary
-------

    TEToolkit is composed of two tools, TEpeaks and TEtranscripts, each described in
    its own section below.

NOTE! Both programs rely on specially curated GTF files, which are not
packaged with this software due to their size. Please check back for an
update to this package's homepage. Once it is up and running, the required
GTFs will be downloadable from there.

    TEpeak takes ChIP-seq (and similar data) alignment files (BAM or BED),
    identiifes narrow peaks, and is also able to do differential analysis over
    peaks of two sets of libraries. It is an extension of MACS by adding the
    funcionality of taking into account multi-reads, another normalization
    method, bin correlation, and differential analysis. The differential
    analysis is performed using DESeq. 

    TEtranscripts takes RNA-seq (and similar data) and annotates reads to both
    genes & transposable elements. It then performs differential analysis using
    DESeq.


Requirements
------------

    Python:     2.6.x or 2.7.x (not tested in Python 3.x)
    pysam    (tested using version 0.8.2.1)
    R:          2.15.x or greater
    DESeq:      1.5.x or greater
